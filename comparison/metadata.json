The chasing and displaying will get more intense as the breeding season progresses with males establishing small, temporary territories into which they shepherd as many females as they can.  But for now, the males are just practicing and with the increasing heat of the afternoon, most of the herd switches to resting.   ",

They have a division of labor among the colony members, with different ants specializing in tasks such as foraging, nest maintenance, and caring for the fungus gardens. Additionally, leafcutter ants have a unique system of communication and are able to use chemical signals to communicate with each other, to find food, and to defend their colony.",

They are also known to undergo seasonal migrations, moving inland during the dry season to avoid desiccation and saltwater intrusion.",

    "Overview": "An undercarriage view of a giraffe. \r\n\r\nA giraffe has only two gaits: walking and galloping. The animal relies on the forward and backward motions of its head and neck to maintain balance and counter momentum while galloping. Giraffes and a few other animals such as brown bear and camel move both legs on one side and then both legs on the other side. In some cases, the hind leg starts first so there is a slight lag. This is known as \"spacing.\"\r\n\r\n",

They derive their common name from the Afrikaans word \"duik\" meaning \"to dive,\" which they frequently do in thick vegetation to escape predators. Duiker are very tolerant of human dwellings and have a diverse diet. While they are mostly herbivorous browsers eating leaves, flowers, fruits and roots, they have also been known to consume insects, frogs, small birds, mammals and carrion.\r\n\r\n",

    "Overview": "Curious and adaptable, spotted hyenas live in advanced, female-dominated clans. That is, males can be clan members, but only as \"second class citizens.\" Hyenas' razor-sharp teeth and exceptionally strong bites (twice as powerful as lions) allow them to eat the bones of old kills when fresh prey is scarce. By cleaning up old kills, hyenas contribute to African ecosystems. They are also efficient hunters, predating primarily on antelope. Female hyenas have a pseudo-penis, which makes identifying females from males difficult. Clan members get information about another's identity and recent whereabouts by sniffing each other's genitalia.\r\n\r\n",

The Falkland's sea lion population was decimated by commercial hunters. Down to to 4% of historical numbers, it has never recovered though hunting was stopped in the 1950s. One possible reason is warming local seawater temperatures, due to climate change, which may be reducing food availability and the ability of females to properly feed their nursing pups.\r\n\r\n",

It inhabits places close to water. Landowners in drier parts of Africa often provide water sources for wildlife. This allows species to survive in areas that have long dry seasons and few permanent water sources such as this one in southern Africa.",

Striated caracaras live on islands in southern South America, primarily the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands. The gregarious and opportunistic feeders keep a turkey vulture from participating in the feast.\r\n\r\nTwo of the caracaras have yellow bands on their legs. The numbered bands help scientists learn how the birds survive in the Falklands. The caracara population is much reduced compared to historical numbers for reasons unknown - scientists hope to learn why.",

They use their sharp eyes to locate food and regularly patrol beaches for dead animals washed up on shore. Where turtles are nesting, they are quick to locate nests that have been disturbed by predators. The birds are not known to harm intact nests. Cleaning up destroyed nests may help reduce infestations of fly maggots that destroy healthy intact nests.\r\n\r\nThis video was collected in collaboration with Osa Conservation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the globally significant biodiversity of the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Studies have shown that those who shine brightest attract the most females. The color is not a pigment. It is caused by the refraction of light (as with rainbows) by highly organized cells on the outside of the scrotum. The females are using brightness as an indicator of overall genetic quality. \r\n\r\n",

The birds will soon be molting into complete new sets of feathers (the \"fuzzy\" looking one has already started). For 2-3 weeks they will not be able to go into the water, so they are bathing while they can. Bathing is important for keeping feathers clean and water-resistant.\r\n\r\n",

    "Overview": "Green Sea Turtles are cleaned by surgeonfish. In coral reef habitats, green sea turtles have a symbiotic relationship with the reef fish that maintain \"cleaning stations.\" Turtles congregate here to have algae removed from their carapaces, flippers and faces. The fish receive a constantly replenished source of food while the turtles get spiffed up for smoother sailing (with less drag).  These cleaning stations are common in the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands where yellow-eyed surgeonfish and some additional species of tangs and wrasses maintain the same \"restaurants\" for many generations of fish.

    "Overview": "In the forest, a bull Asian elephant (only bulls have tusks in this species) checks out the reproductive readiness of a female with his trunk. He takes a sample of her urine with his trunk and inserts his trunk into the back of his mouth and exposes the sample to a sensory receptor, known as Jacobson's organ. These highly sensitive cells on the organ detect whether she is in estrus and ready to mate If she were, he would immediately raise his trunk over her back and attempt to mount her. Females show a preference for older, larger bulls.\r\n\r\n",

Watering holes not only provide a source of hydration for the visiting animals but also serve as grazing locations.\r\n\r\nThe gemsbok is a species of large antelope recognizable in part by their nearly straight horns. Both sexes of gemsbok have horns, with the female's being slightly longer and more slender, and the male's being shorter and thicker. The species forms mixed-gender herds, unlike other antelope species which form male-dominant harems, and are the National Animal of Namibia. \r\n\r\n",

Black-browed albatross mate for life and have a potential lifespan of up to 70 years. However, tens of thousands are killed each year by longline fishing vessels, which trail thousands of baited hooks on lines up to 80 miles long. The albatross mistake the bait for their food of choice: squid, krill, and fish eggs floating at or near the ocean's surface. The proper weighting of hooks can mitigate the threat.\r\n\r\n",

    "Overview": "A herd of African elephant mothers in Zimbabwe protect their babies by keeping them underfoot.\r\n\r\nWith baby elephants, as with their human counterparts, babies can ignore proper etiquette. When the elephants start to drink, the smaller youngster butts in between two females to get a drink. The adolescent tries to squeeze in and fails, forced to wait its turn. Since elephants often range far between drinking opportunities, young must fill up when they can. After they drink and linger at a waterhole, the tightly-knit family group moves along.\r\n\r\n",

According to IUCN, the Asian elephant is primarily threatened by loss of habitat and poaching. As their habitat is lost, interactions with humans (human/elephant conflict) are increasing in frequency and intensity, with fatalities occurring on both sides. \r\n\r\n",

These critically endangered animals were rescued from poachers and now live in Kenya at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a wildlife sanctuary for the northern white rhino as well as more than 110 endangered black rhinos. The fate of the northern white rhino is uncertain, as Najin and Fatu are unable to produce offspring due to their ages, and the sole remaining male northern white rhino died in 2018. With no offspring to continue the lineage, the sub-species is all but extinct. However, scientists plan to fertilize eggs harvested from these females with sperm from the male to produce northern white rhino embryos that would then be implanted in southern white rhino surrogates.\r\n\r\n",

Each year, from October to April, rockhoppers migrate by the thousands to breed among the rocky cliffs of these remote islands. Swift swimmers in the water, thye use their bellies and flippers to maneuver from water onto land. A layer of fat and waterproof feathers keeps them warm in freezing temperatures. Overfishing reduces their food source and contributes to their population decline.\r\n\r\n",

A sett's entrance is frequently marked by discarded dried straw, leaves and grass, which are used as bedding materials. This discarded matter also doubles as a way to mark the clan's territory.",

While the birth rate of male and female cubs is nearly 1:1, humans kill far more male bears than females, and, as such, among the mature bear population there is often only one male for every 2-5 females.",

American black bears are found in coniferous and deciduous forests, pinyon-juniper woodlands, chaparral and even desert scrub and grasslands. In Mexico, American black bears inhabit plant communities dominated by deciduous and evergreen oaks and montane chaparral. Their diets vary seasonally with food availability. In springtime, grasses and forbs make up the bulk of the American black bear's caloric intake, with berries and insects being preferred during summer. In the fall, the bears feed primarily on acorns and other nuts before hibernation. ",

The frogs appear overnight above these ponds and lay their eggs on leaves. When the eggs hatch in six days, the tadpoles fall into the pond below. The adults disappear into the canopy as quickly as they arrived.\r\n\r\nThis video was collected in collaboration with Osa Conservation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the globally significant biodiversity of the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica.",

    "Overview": "A cheetah, being prepared for release into a national park, licks and bites the camera as it lounges around its water hole. The cheetah is considered vulnerable to extinction because its global population is declining. Thus, numerous efforts are being made to reestablish and fortify existing local populations by releasing individuals from areas where their numbers are stable. Conservationists call this rewilding. It is an important, though expensive tool, that has brought numerous species back from the brink of extinction. \r\n\r\n",

The common barn owl is important to keeping the ecosystem in balance as their diet consists of mice, rats and other small animals. The flutings on an owl’s feathers break up the air around their wing, which makes for nearly silent while flapping. This makes them effective hunters. They also have zygodactyl toes with two in the front and two in the back, however, they can also move one toe forward for capturing prey.",

They are the largest of all wild equines, have larger ears and narrower stripes. Studies show that their stripes serve to protect them from various threats, such as biting insects and other predators. This could be due to the polarizing effect light has when the zebra is stationary, compared to other animal coat patterns. Other studies suggest that stripes produce visual illusions, such as the wagon wheel effect, when in motion, making it harder for flies and insects to land.\r\n\r\n",

A lion’s tongue is covered in tiny spines, which face backwards, and are used to scrape meat from bones. ",

    "Overview": "An agouti and a coati forage for food in Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nAlthough these species' biological niche spaces may occasionally overlap due to the coati's more generalist nature, agoutis are part of the order Rodentia, whereas coati are classified as order Carnivora. While agoutis primarily consume fallen fruit, leaves and roots, they have occasionally been seen to eat bird eggs as well, a habit they also have in common with the coati. Agoutis are one of the few species that can open Brazil nuts without tools, thanks to their strength and exceptionally sharp teeth.\r\n\r\n",

The Bees for Elephants program uses wild African honey bees and their hives, hung on fences in strategic areas, to guard crops and help protect communities. When migrating elephants bump the fences and disturb the hives, the defensive bees sting the elephants and chase them away. Elephants learn what areas to avoid and pass that information on to other members of the herd. Communities and elephants benefit from fewer human-wildlife conflicts. Beekeepers benefit from  the honey the bees produce which is sold at local markets.",

The wolves were hunted and killed due to perceived conflicts with game species and livestock until the 1940's when they were rarely seen. By the middle of the century, wolves were almost completely lost from the lower 48 United states. After the grey wolf was classified as an endangered species in 1974, efforts began the following year to restore a population in Yellowstone. However, it was not until 1995 that 31 wolves were relocated to the park from western Canada. \r\n\r\n",

However, it is relatively rare for crocodiles to successfully take down adult hippos, as they are large and aggressive animals that can defend themselves effectively. More commonly, crocodiles scavenge on dead or weakened hippos that have died from natural causes or other causes.",

As a result, competition amongst vultures over carrion can occur. This competition can be fierce and violent, with birds pushing, pecking and clawing at each other in order to gain access to food.\r\n\r\nThe unique adaptation of vultures is their bald head, which helps them dissipate heat but also aids in keeping their head clean while fighting and eating, since no feathers would get stuck in the blood and remains. Additionally, vultures have strong, sharp beaks and talons that they use to tear at carrion and fend off rivals.",

Ranging from Morocco throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, it is the most widespread type of leopard in the world. A leopard's fur is generally soft and thick, notably softer on the belly than on the back. Its hair color varies between individuals, from pale yellow to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Normally solitary animals, adults associate only during the mating season.\r\n\r\n",

Every year, the \"great wildebeest migration\" consists of more than one million wildebeest that follow the rain patterns between Kenya and Tanzania. They help guide other species to water and food. Wildebeest are considered one of the most important keystone species in Africa’s ecosystems and without them the entire ecosystem will collapse.",

    "Overview": "Dr. Will Fowlds of Amakhala Game Reserve pursues a matriarch near a wildlife lodge to dart her with a birth control vaccine.  Elephant birth control is an effective means at controlling populations before they get too large or out of balance.  Wildlife reserves practice active population management using immunocontraception. Many reserves have seen effective population growth reductions of at least 50%.",

Lions are apex predators, as they help regulate the populations of other animals such as herbivores and other species. If one prey species becomes too abundant, it can make an entire ecosystem unhealthy. Grasses and other food will become less abundant for all other species to thrive.  Scientists believe that healthy predator populations help maintain functioning ecosystems.",

While it looks strange to see a rhino hanging upside down, it is a quicker mode of transportation when there are no roads to accommodate transport trucks.  The rhinos are tranquilized, blindfolded and ear plugged to minimize sensations.  While hanging them upside down may be the easiest way to transport them, scientific studies have also determined that this allows more oxygen exchange compared to hanging them in a “lying sideways” position.  But even transporting upside-down has its challenges. Here, a tranquilizer dart becomes lodged into the skin upon landing.",

    "Name": "Decomposing Norway Rat Visited by Beetles and Squirrel",
    "Overview": "A pine squirrel investigates the carcass of a Norway rat as margined burying beetles crawl across the carrion during the early stages of decomposition.\r\n\r\nSquirrels, like many of their rodent relations, are surprisingly omnivorous. In addition to their familiar diet of nuts and seeds, squirrels are scavengers by nature and have been known to eat carrion. By contrast, the margined burying beetle feeds almost exclusively on decaying animals. These insects use their sensitive antennae to locate rotting flesh. Once found, they will proceed to devour the material and in some cases, cover it with the surrounding substrate, resulting in accelerated decomposition of the carcass.\r\n\r\n",
